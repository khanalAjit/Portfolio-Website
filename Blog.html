        <h3>What is Technology?</h3>    <!--Heading-->

        <!-- Using article tag to write an article-->
        <article>
            Technology can be defined as the science or knowledge put into practice to solve  problems or invent useful tools.
            It brings about a change to the human environment. It can also be called a development making human life easier,
            luxurious and sustainable. For exmaple : The prehistoric means to create a fire was to strike the stones together 
            or to use the friction of the woods. But, today the technology has given us a flame thrower. The tiresome walking to
            travel a distance is replaced by vehicles, aeroplanes, ships and trains. The communication and interconnection between
            people has grately increased due to the invention and use of internet.

            Along with the advancement in time, there has been an advancement in the technology. Along with peoples knowledge
            the technology used in  day to day life has improved. The traditional way of gringing the maslas is now made by
            grinders and mixtures. The simplest example can be the housing and clothing. The caves have been improved with time 
            as huts, cottages, houses, buildings, and even mansions. The leaf used to cover the skin and to protect one from cold
            has turned into tech involved jackets with builtin heaters and earphones. The advancement in science and the achievements
            it gave has given us countless technologies. From the nip of the pen to the zip of the pen a technology is used. <br> <br>
            From making the manual labour work easier to overtaking the work technology has changed the lives of the peoples.
            Now there is almost nothing a man can achieve. Can you imagine? the man that faught to survive with other men are now 
            a part of the single world. From running in the fields to  flying in the sky, from worshiping the moon to landing on 
            the moon, form giving birth without even a painkiller to giving birth in the world's most convinient faculties without
            even feeling a single pain, how a persons life has changed. <br>

<h2>Impact of Technology In My Daily Life</h2>      <!--Heading-->

            As I am a student, the advancement in technology has affected my daily life in a huge way. It has changed the way I think,
            the way I feel, the way I read, the way I interact with people and many more. I remember the days playing football in the 
            fields, now its just me and the boys playing fifa infront of a screen. The sweat, the fun and the relaxtation I felt back 
            in the days has turned into cussing, frustration and boredom.

            Even the way of eudcation has changed. I who hadn't even seen a computer in the childhood is now learning stuffs 
            using one. The bulky notes I used to own has now changed to a simple word file or a pdf. The fee payment has also changed
            as the schools that didnt use cheques and made the cash compulsary now  hardly does the card transaction. The 
            ATM machine which I had only read about or seen in the movies, is being used by me. Most importantly due to the 
            pandemic the same schools that had banned the use of mobiles and laptops is now encouraging the parents to buy 
            one for their child. The traditional prison like education system has now been digitalised and more entertaining.
