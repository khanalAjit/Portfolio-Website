    <!-- Using paragraph tag to describe the page -->
    <p>
        This page is about the research I have done for doing this project or say about making this website.
        As this is my first time making a webpage and using css and java script I had some problem at the beginning.
        I didn't even have any idea how to make the webpage look like let alone starting to make one. But, from the 
        help of my tutor I got an idea about it. I then imagined the page I wanted to make and the page required. Then, 
        I started surfing the internet looking for the design, looking for the inspiration for my webpage. After a long 
        period of looking through almost all the websites I could find, I then set-up my mind and started making one.
        So, some websites that inspired me are shown below along with the webpages I made. 
    </p>

    <h2>Navigation Bar</h2>     <!--Heading-->

    <div class="part">          <!--Using the class 'part'-->

        <div class="half">
            <figure>
                <img src="Images/Naveg.png" alt="NavBar">          <!--Adding an image-->
                <figcaption>Nav Bar inspired from</figcaption>  <!--Caption for the image-->
            </figure>
        </div>

        <div class="half">
            <figure>
                <img src="Images/Mynav.png" alt="My Nav Bar">          <!--Adding an image-->
                <figcaption>My Nav Bar</figcaption>                 <!--Caption for the image-->
            </figure>
        </div>

    </div>

    <!--Using paragraph tag to describe the similarities and differences between the shown images-->
    <p>
        In this website, I looked at the design of the navgation bar. As it was on the top right corner of the 
        page, it looked nice and simple. I inspected the nav bar and saw list tag was used to make it. So, I 
        made my own navigation bar on the right side adding some unique background color and hover effect.
        I used unordered list to make the navigation bar. Then, using the css I removed the text decorations of the list. 
        I also flexed the display to divide my name and the navigation bar into two sides, making it look beautiful.

    <h2>Blog</h2>       <!--Heading-->

    <div class="part">              <!--Using the class 'part'-->

        <div class="half">
            <figure>
                <img src="Images/blogeg.png" alt="Blog">           <!--Adding an image-->
                <figcaption>Blog style inspired from</figcaption>       <!--Caption for the image-->

        <div class="half">
            <figure>
                <img src="Images/MyBlog.png" alt="My Blog">        <!--Adding an image-->
                <figcaption>My Blog</figcaption>            <!--Caption for the image-->

        </div>

    </div>


    <!--Using paragraph tag to describe the similarities and differences between the shown images-->
    <p>             
        After going through many blogs this blog finally caught my eyes. The way she wrote her blog really inspired me 
        to do the similar. She had parted the display into two parts, ads and the actual writing. As I dont have to add 
        any ads here, I parted them for image and the article. This made my own bolg look cleaner and attractive. 
        I used CSS to design the size of the test, image, and the background colour of the class. CSS tags like padding,
        margin made the blog a lot cleaner and understandable.

    <h2> Contact Form</h2>              <!--Heading-->

    <div class="part">              <!--Using the class 'part'-->

                <img src="Images/Contacteg.png" alt="Contact form example">        <!--Adding an image-->
                <figcaption>Inspiration for contact form </figcaption>      <!--Caption for the image-->
            </figure>

        <div class="half">

                <img src="Images/MyContact.png" alt="My contact form">         <!--Adding an image-->

    <p>
        After viewing many complex forms and analysing them, I inspected the form of this page and found it simple, easier
        and effective. So, I made a similar looking design inspired from this page and used tags like input, textarea, and
        button. I also wrote a function to validate the message using java script. Incase of empty field I made an alert 
        message to remind the user to fill the form properly before sending it.

    <p>
        Among all the websites I found this webpage catchy. There isn't much drama here an user can know what the page is 
        about. The changing picture also made an impression on me. So I also created a similar function which changes the 
        picture displayed after the user clicks a button. Using java script this was made possible where CSS also played a 
        role in decorating the image shown. Also I added a link to my blog for the user describing the basic content of my blog.

        This website caught my eye, as it was so different from other websites I was checking out. It was unique and 
        interesting, they way he presented his about page was amazing. He programmed to show the link about his about section
        when we hover around his name in the homepage. This inspired me but was too complex to do while trying. So I linked 
        the page in my navigation bar itself.
