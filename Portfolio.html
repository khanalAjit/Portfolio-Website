                Hi, My name is Ajit Khanal. Born in the year 2001 December 24, you can call me the hybrid of the late 90's kid
                and the gen Z. To talk about my education, I studied in two different schools (Monohara and Monastic). I was what people call a
                bookworm. Atleast they thought I was. But on the other hand I was kind of a lazy guy who loved sleeping and playing with gadgets.
                Believe me I was almost kicked out from my own house for messing up with the Television. I spent my time imagining stuffs that 
                probably is impossible to happen in real life even now. Still my academics were pretty good as I never had to hide my test report 
                from my parents. Perhaps that was the reason for my friends to call me a bookworm.

            <h3>Academics and Achievements</h3>

            <article>
                Funny thing is even the teachers thaught I was a good kid who never makes noise in the class and is good at studies. Well they were 
                right about the studying part but believe me when I say that my friends were punished for the noise I made. Having an innocent face
                became an advantage for my pranks. I pulled off countless pranks but was only busted once. Let's not reveal why and how I was busted
                here. If you really wamt to know you can dm me in the social medias given at the end of the page. Now let me flex my achievements. I swear
                with my hands over a geeta book that whatever I say will be the truth and only the truth. So lets start with indoor games, I was the 
                house Captain of the Green House and participated and helped in organizing almost every Extracurricular Activies that happend in the school.
                But I was best at Quiz and Debate. I was the school champion of Table Tennis from grade 7 to grade 9. So I was given a chance to participate 
                in the interschool TT competition organized at SOS which unfortunately I lost. I was also the Badminton Champion of the School. But the 
                thing I was best at was Football (Soccer). Due to the earthquake I was only able to paticipate in the Interschool Football Competition (FISM)
                only once. Still I was the highest scorer and lost the game in the semifinals in the penalty shootout. It is already a long article 
                so I am stopping here. But hey if you want to talk with me and share literally anything find me in the social medias given below.
